An implementation of asteroids in Python 3.12 using the PyGame 2.6.1 framework.

This is a project that I followed along from a training website called Boot.Dev.

If I were to continue working on this project, I think it would be cool to add:
- new threats that appear
- power ups
- ship customization
- start menu -> difficulty, color settings
- ship momementum
- shots killed on asteroid impact
